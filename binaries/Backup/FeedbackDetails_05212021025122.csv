"05/20/2021","4","111-3508167-7684231","The parts(top and base arrived separately), but both arrived ?. It was easy to assemble, but took longer to adjust for not being wobbly. Now it’s good and looks great!"

"05/20/2021","5","112-2795930-0153025","I absolutely love my new nightstand!! I purchased it after buying the dresser that matches. I have been slowly redecorating my bedroom and I love the color, style and it is a very sturdy piece of furniture."
"05/20/2021","4","113-4481156-7693819","works well with the present office furniture"
"05/20/2021","5","114-4228137-1102668","Exactly what I needed. Built-in hangers a very nice feature. Handle screws were a bit difficult to start for this ex-professional handyman so I wound up using a small drill which made it a lot easier. Of course, this little bit of assembly is only done once, really simple and I only mention the problem I had to help improve an already fine product."

"05/19/2021","1","112-7968367-5164220","I received the nightstands undamaged. However, I ordered the “cherry” finish, instead I got dark brown."

Refund issued package not picked up."
"05/18/2021","1","113-8060444-8784224","We never received the long dresser. The first time I contacted the seller, I was told they would resolve the issue and contact me back in 48 hours. I ended up contacting them a 2nd time after not hearing back, after a week. As of today I have sent now 3 requests to seller with no response. In hopes someone sees my review, I do not want a refund , just the missing dresser."
"05/18/2021","5","112-4135902-5433004","All is good, part 2 of delivery arrived today disregard my query reference missing part 2"
"05/18/2021","4","111-9527818-1398660","The stain and finish were sub-standard. This is a quality control issue or they do not value excellence. I had to resort to furniture polish to redeem the appearance of the finish. What did I like? They shipped it faster than expected, the shelves are very sturdy, and the bookcase holds between 125-150 hardback books."
